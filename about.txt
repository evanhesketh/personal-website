Before launching my career in software engineering, I was a professional musician for over a decade, playing violin and viola with orchestras in Canada and California. As a performer, I spent countless hours perfecting my technique, always striving to improve my playing in every way possible. The goal? To present the most polished and moving performances to my audiences. As a teacher, I translated my experiences into easy to grasp ideas so that my students could learn to take on any musical challenges they desired.

Now, I use the same principles that helped me succeed as a musician to build functional, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing web applications:  a drive to always be learning, a desire to be an effective communicator and collaborator, and a love of details while keeping the big picture in mind. Instead of notes on a page, my new medium is lines of code.
